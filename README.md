# Library version 3
This is an early attempt at creating the new TG academy library project. The main requirements of the project are:
- Responsive UI (iPhone 6 and desktop at a minimum) with >= 90% accessibility score on Lighthouse
- Display books (eg table, cards) dynamically populated from array of book objects, with pagination
- Ability to add a book, modify an existing book, delete a book, and find books by title and/or author
- Form input validation with jQuery, user interaction testing with Cypress, and unit testing with Jest
- HTTP requests set up for all GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations, with canonical response handling
- Node/Express RESTful API with MongoDB/Mongoose handle HTTP requests and CRUD operations
